# My Golang Study Handbook

Personal golang exercises from various sources

Each exercise sample a unique behavior and might or might not rely on
techniques already shown before.

## How to run each sample code

Enter inside each individual exercise folder and
`go run <filename>.go [arguments maybe]`.

A dedicated README.md file might exist sometimes.

## What I am studying and what I am not

I am looking at general operations that can be sampled on small snippets.

I am following a metastructure for multi-purposes programming languages creating
sample cases for specific features that such kind of language are supposed to
provide in order to solve common problems that computers should resolve.

In a very simplistic way, i am exploring all possible ways to grab data from the
disk, put it into memory, do some calculations and then put it back into storage.

I am not structuring big brains project configs, there will be other projects
just to do that.

~~I am not into syntax abuse party~~ [I may do a little syntax abuse 
sometimes](exercises/0005-todo-list-file/todo-list-v1.go), yet all snippets
should be clean and objective, easy to understand.

I am not evangelizing the lang, the lang should evangelize by itself.

I am not here to say that one IDE/Editor is the best for the job, pick whatever
you want to punch code against the system.

## A roadmap-ish path

Besides folowing [a few](https://cursos.alura.com.br/formacao-go) 
[online courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-programming-language/learn/lecture/5985510?start=0#overview),
there is no defined path here.

However, I expect a few key techniques to be sampled over those exercises:

- hello world
- handle low level (console) user input (interactive, parameters, env vars)
- comparison
- loops
- basic I/O (files)
- unit testing
- concurrency (go routines and channels)
- intermediate I/O (sockets)
- database connection
- REST service

After that, mostly everything else ends up in reading docs from some library
