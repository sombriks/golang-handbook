# My Golang Handbook

Personal golang exercises from various sources

## How to run each sample code

Enter inside each individual exercise folder and `go run <filename>.go [arguments maybe]`.
A dedicated README.md file might exist.

## What i am studying and what i am not

I am looking at general operations that can be sampled on small snippets.

I am not structuring big brains project configs, there will be other projects
just to do that.
